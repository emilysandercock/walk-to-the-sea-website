While Government Center is now considered the heart of Boston's judicial and legislative branches, prior to the 1960s it represented a part of the city that did not necessarily fall in line with the puritanical sensibilities that often characterized the city. Formerly known as Scollay Square, In his completed  [the Government Center Urban Renewal Plan and final project report](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/book_viewer/commonwealth:1544mb47d#?xywh=-1450%2C1303%2C3526%2C2639&cv=) Boston Development Administrator Edward J. Logue succeeded at replacing what he characterized as "a notoriously decadent and dilapidated area," with the present day Government Center. The goal was to create a major center of government and private activity. In a way the vast empty space of city hall plaza and the brutalist architectural design of the new city hall represents an iron fist that flattens parts of the city that were labeled as degenerate. Nevertheless, while government center may have provided a new place of public gathering and political deliberation, its existence came at the cost of one of the cultural and commercial landmarks that characterized Boston's West End.

# The Cultural Scene at Scollay Square
Scollay Square housed a lively theater, and comedy scene that entertained thousands of Bostonians for decades. One of the more controversial theatrical performances that were frequented in Scollay Square were the risqué Burlesque performances. While there were a variety of theaters that hosted these performances, the most famous of which was the [Howard Atheneaum](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/west-boston/the-howard-athenaeum/), popularly known as the Old Howard Theater. In addition to the Old Howard Theater, there was the Crawford House, Star Theater, and Olympia Theater competed with their own shows.

Within Scollay Square there were a variety of other forms of entertainment to be found beyond just Burlesque shows. In fact, the Burlesque shows shot up in popularity around the 1920s, before then most theaters showed a variety of [vaudeville, slapstick comedy, circus performers, boxing matches, and pantomime](https://thewestendmuseum.org/history/era/immigrant-neighborhood/scollay-square/). One of the more important cultural dimensions that the entertainment and commercial district brought to the city, is the nightlife that came with the taverns and bars. Scollay Square had significant value to the lgbtq+ community during the first half of the 20th century. The Rialto, also known as the Star Theater, is an example of one of the locals that hosted bars where members of the lgbtq+ would frequent as noted by the accalimed study on the history of gay and lesbian history in Boston, *Improper Bostonians.* Overall, Scollay Square represented  side of Boston that did not sit well with the conservative elites.

Not a lot remains of Old Scollay Square in Government Center today, but there a still a few remnants that can be visited today. One of the more interesting landmarks that can still be found includes the famous Boston Steaming Tea kettle that can be found today at 63-65 Court St. However, this famous tea kettle was not always located in that spot. The Kettle was funded by the Oriental Tea company as a promotional gimick. Therefore, on the 1st of January 1875, the fully functioning animatronic tea kettle was placed just above Oriental Tea at 85 and 87 Court St. Eventually, like the rest of Scollay Square, Oriental Tea would not survive, but the [tea kettle](https://www.boston.com/news/wickedpedia/2023/11/28/big-tea-kettle-government-center-starbucks-boston-ma/) would thanks to the owner at the time buying a location further down the road.

The tea kettle's current location is ironically situated in the exact position where another Scollay landmark stood for decades. This would be the John Withrope statue that has moved all the way to Back Bay.
