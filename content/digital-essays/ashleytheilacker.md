On the eve of the American Revolution, Boston was a bustling hub of global import and export. Along with the European influence colonists brought with them, Bostonians were influenced in furniture, food, and fashion from other countries and continents around the world. Boston sometimes even provided other countries with unconventional goods, showcasing its remarkable global impact as a trading port. 

While this essay highlights some of the most interesting goods in colonial Boston's economy, the city's influence extended to nearly every corner of the Atlantic world.

# Chinoiserie: A Symbol of Status 

Most of the products imported from China and other Eastern Asian countries in colonial times - silk, porcelain, tea - were considered luxurious to Western buyers. East Asia as a region had long been mythologized in the Western world; the European explorer Friar Williams, for example, described China with romanticized features like ["a city with walls of silver and gold."](https://archive.org/details/contemporariesof00komr/page/118/mode/2up?q=cathay). The intricate style of decoration in East Asian countries became desirable to wealthy Europeans, and in the mid 18th century, designers began creating [Chinoiserie](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/chinoiserie-an-introduction?srsltid=AfmBOoof7wWqhXXkQHdUqSdySSUL7FPrwVCCDrL8RB0MAkbnkd4CVd6l). This style combined decorative elements of Japanese, Chinese, and Indian furniture and pottery, and was driven by the Rococo movement. Colonists brought this style to Boston with them, with styles such as blue-and-white porcelain dishware becoming iconic to the period.  

This teabowl was created in the early 18th century and features blue and white porcelain with a red design. The bowl features several men in Chinese dress, flowing red vines and birds, and gold accents. The matching saucer depicts a Chinese countryside scene, and both items are in The Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection.

These dish fragments, excavated from the [James Garrett House Site](https://www.boston.gov/departments/archaeology/james-garrett-house-site), show the influence of blue and white pottery on colonial Boston.

Kitchenware was not the only product influenced by East Asian design. This pinewood cabinet, created in 1753, is painted using black and gold and depicts idealized scenes of Chinese landscape and figures. This technique is called ["Japanning,"](https://books.google.com/books?id=dZhDEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) a type of finish meant to imitate East Asian lacquerwork and furniture style. Importing true Asian lacquer from China or Japan was incredibly expensive and restricted to only the wealthiest classes in Europe, so this imitation allowed the style to become more accessible. European craftsmen were sent overseas to learn these techniques, and over time Western craftsmen began adopting more native materials like pine, fur, or spruce resin. These pieces often included visual motifs like dragons, tigers, and intricate birds and used colors like red, gold, and black.

# A Colonial Toast to Madeira Wine 

This is a test section. This section will be about Madeira wine and its import to boston. 

This is a second test paragraph. It will say something very interesting and include some good photos and archival material, too. 

# Boston's Icy Export 

Today, New England is widely known for its harsh winters and frozen rivers, and it was no different in colonial times. Even in the coldest of the colonies, though, year-round ice for everyday use was considered a luxury. Upper class citizens were able to install [ice houses](https://www.monticello.org/encyclopedia/ice-house) in their homes, ice was never considered a commodity until one man saw a potential market.

Born in 1783 and educated at Harvard, Frederic Tudor began Boston's ice trade when he was only 23 years old. Tudor's upper class background allowed him to enjoy the luxury of cold drinks and ice cream, and he believed the appeal could reach both nationwide and globally. [His first export to Martinique](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.150907/page/n193/mode/2up?q=tudor) "excited the derision of the whole town as a mad project." Shipping companies [refused to partner with Tudor on his endeavor,](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-ice-king-cometh-frederic-tudor-father-of-the-ice-industry-29955743/) so he was forced to innovate ships that could transport ice across the Atlantic ocean as far as Rio de Janeiro, Calcutta, and Hong Kong, as well as build ice houses at each of his ports to keep the cargo from melting upon arrival.

Tudor planned to ensure that countries would be able to afford his ice. In 1849, he [wrote](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25079177?seq=5), 

> The plan which I had about this time adopted in my ice trade was not to act the monopolist, but to give the ice to the consumer, in all the southern regions, at a low price ; considering, that, in so doing, I was dealing more justly with the consumer, and best assisting the progress of the business. Thus, in Jamaica, the ice is sold at half the price, and, in Calcutta, at a less price, than it is sold in London.

By the mid-1800s, Boston was exporting nearly [75,000 tons of ice globally,](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2022/tracing-the-history-of-new-england-ice-trade/) with much of it harvested from Fresh Pond in Cambrige. Tudor's international renown in the ice trade business gave him the title of Boston's "Ice King." Tudor's success also brought him into the social spheres of prominent American men, such as Thomas Jefferson, to whom he wrote [letters](https://founders.archives.gov/?q=Correspondent%3A%22Jefferson%2C%20Thomas%22%20Correspondent%3A%22Tudor%2C%20Frederic%22&s=1111311111&r=1) regarding his ideas and plans for building more efficient ships. Tudor was worth nearly $200 million in today's dollars by the time of his death. 

Even after Tudor's death, the ice trade remained a prominent part of New England's economy. As more individuals and companies inserted themselves into the lucrative business, rivers and ponds began to be legally divided between them, as shown in this 1894 map created by a Boston ice dealer.
