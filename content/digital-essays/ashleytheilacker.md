On the eve of the American Revolution, Boston was a bustling hub of global import and export. Along with the European influence colonists brought with them, Bostonians were influenced in furniture, food, and fashion from other countries and continents around the world. Boston sometimes even provided other countries with unconventional goods, showcasing its remarkable global impact as a trading port. 

While this essay highlights some of the most interesting goods in colonial Boston's economy, the city's influence extended to nearly every corner of the Atlantic world.

# Chinoiserie: A Symbol of Status 

In the 16th century, most of the products imported from China and other Eastern Asian countries - silk, porcelain, tea - were considered luxurious. East Asia as a concept had long been mythologized, with European explorers like Friar Williams describing China with romanticized features like ["a city with walls of silver and gold."](https://archive.org/details/contemporariesof00komr/page/118/mode/2up?q=cathay), and the intricate style of decoration became desirable to wealthy Europeans. In the mid 18th century, designers began creating [Chinoiserie](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/chinoiserie-an-introduction?srsltid=AfmBOoof7wWqhXXkQHdUqSdySSUL7FPrwVCCDrL8RB0MAkbnkd4CVd6l). This style combined decorative elements of Japanese, Chinese, and Indian furniture and pottery, and was driven by the Rococo movement. Colonists brought this style to Boston with them, with possibly the most iconic style being blue-and-white porcelain dishware.  

This teabowl was created in the early 18th century

Kitchenware was not the only product influenced by East Asan design. This pinewood cabinet, created in 1753, is painted using black and gold and depicts idealized scenes of Chinese landscape and figures. This technique is called ["Jappanning,"](https://books.google.com/books?id=dZhDEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) a type of finish meant to imitate East Asian lacquerwork and furniture style. Importing true Asian lacquer from China or Japan was incredibly expensive and restricted to only the wealthiest classes in Europe, so this imitation allowed the style to become more accessible. European craftsmen were sent overseas to learn these techniques, and over time Western craftsmen began adopting more native materials like pine, fur, or spruce resin. These pieces often included visual motifs like dragons, tigers, and intricate birds and used colors like red, gold, and black.

# Paragraph 2 Undecided 

This is a test section. This section will be about another interesting import to Boston that people might not know about. 

This is a second test paragraph. It will say something very interesting and include some good photos and archival material, too. 

# Boston's Icy Export 

This is a test paragraph for fomatting purposes. This paragraph will be about how ice was considered a luxury and about Frederic Tudor. Maybe it will include a photo of him, as well as some good information. 

This will become another paragraph about Boston's ice exports. I think this is the most interesting topic. Hopefully people read this far!
