# Construction of Long Wharf

Constructed in 1711 and extending far beyond any other wharf, Long Wharf symbolized the importance of maritime trade to Boston’s economy. At [1,586 feet long](https://www.nps.gov/places/long-wharf-boston.htm), (about a third of a mile), the wharf allowed up to 50 vessels to dock and unload without
needing smaller boats to transport goods to shore. The physical structure of Long Wharf, and the eventual changes made to it, are inherently linked to
Boston’s economy and the importance of maritime trade.

Due to the harbor’s central location, Boston’s economy greatly benefited from international trade across the Atlantic. [In the 1600s, trade in 
colonial America was led by financiers in Great Britain.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/piecing-together-the-atlantic-empire-of-peter-faneuil.htm) 
But by the 1700s, New England merchants operated independently, using their own vessels and creating their own networks. The construction of Long 
Wharf in 1711 offered New England merchants increased autonomy over their enterprise and highlighted how critical maritime trade was to the economy of
the colonial city. The extreme length of the wharf not only facilitated and grew maritime trade in Boston, but became a physical symbol of the city’s 
reliance on maritime trade.

# Changes to Long Wharf

In the mid-1800s, as part of a larger fill project across the city, Long Wharf was shortened as Boston’s shoreline was expanded.

The above image shows the section of Long Wharf now covered by fill (land highlighted in yellow and blue). This construction represents a shift away 
from maritime economy to other kinds of commerce and transportation. In the mid-18th century, trade declined in Boston and Long Wharf became less 
critical to the city’s economy. As the economy of Boston harbor shifted from international trade to local commerce and fishing, the harbor’s landscape 
was transformed to mimic this shift in economic reliance. With the decline in maritime trade, it benefited the economy more to have a larger 
waterfront with many wharves suitable for smaller boats, as opposed to one long wharf equipped for many large ships.

# Boston Elite

Throughout its history, Long Wharf has been representative of Boston’s economy, and therefore the priorities of the Boston elite. Original 
construction of Long Wharf was funded by the elites of Boston who financially benefited from trade across the Atlantic. In the mid-1800s, the 
significance of maritime trade to Boston’s economy began to decline and thus the importance of Long Wharf diminished. Throughout the 19th century, the 
elite social class known as the Boston Associates funded construction projects reclaiming land throughout the city—notably the land now comprising the 
Back Bay neighborhood.

The fill of Back Bay offered the Boston Associates a protected enclave of space, distinct from the commercial areas of the city. The development of 
the Back Bay neighborhood clearly links Boston's urban landscape to a social structure which highlights the priorities of the elite. As part of the 
fill project, Boston’s shoreline expanded eastward and shortened Long Wharf to about [0.1 of a mile]([https://www.nps.gov/places/long-wharf-north.htm](https://www.nps.gov/places/long-wharf-north.htm). Just as Long Wharf’s physical structure had symbolized the importance of maritime trade in the 
1700s, the current landscape of the area emphasizes shifting priorities among the Boston elite. 

As Boston’s Long Wharf was shortened in the century between 1880 and 1980, the urban landscape mimicked the diminishing importance of maritime trade
to Boston’s economy. While not as prominent in the landscape today, Long Wharf still serves as a site of modern water transportation for commuters and
tourists. The surrounding area reflects these shifting priorities with restaurants and sites catered to tourism and recreation, rather than maritime 
trade. The wharf, no longer the center point of the neighborhood, exists alongside prominent structures like the New England Aquarium and the Union 
Oyster House. Once the physical focal point of Boston, Long Wharf is now one part of a larger infrastructure serving commerce and tourism in Boston 
Harbor.
