# Construction of Long Wharf

Constructed in 1711, Long Wharf symbolized the importance of maritime trade to Boston’s economy. At [1,586 feet long](https://www.nps.gov/places/long-wharf-boston.htm), the wharf allowed up to 50 vessels to dock and unload without needing smaller boats to transport goods to shore. The physical 
structure of Long Wharf, and the eventual changes made to it, are inherently linked to Boston’s economy and prioritization of resources.

Due to Boston’s central location, the city’s economy greatly benefited from mid-Atlantic trade. [In the 1600s, trade in colonial America was led by
financiers in Great Britain.](https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/piecing-together-the-atlantic-empire-of-peter-faneuil.htm) But by the 1700s, New 
England merchants operated independently, using their own vessels and creating their own networks. The construction of Long Wharf in 1711 offered New 
England merchants increased autonomy over their enterprise and highlighted how critical maritime trade was to the economy of the colonial city. The 
extreme length of the wharf not only facilitated and grew maritime trade in Boston, but became a physical symbol of the city’s reliance on maritime 
trade.

# Changes to Long Wharf

In the mid-1800s, as part of a larger fill project across the city, Long Wharf was shortened as Boston’s shoreline was expanded.

The above image shows the section of Long Wharf now covered by fill (land highlighted in yellow and blue). This construction represents a shift away
from maritime economy to other kinds of commerce and transportation. In the mid-18th century, trade declined in Boston and Long Wharf became less 
critical to the city’s economy. The economy of Boston harbor shifted from international trade to local commerce and fishing. So the harbor’s landscape 
was transformed to mimic this shift in economic reliance; it benefited the economy more to have a larger waterfront with many wharves suitable for 
smaller boats, as opposed to one long wharf equipped for many large ships.

# Boston Elite

Throughout its history, Long Wharf has been representative of Boston’s economy, and therefore the priorities of the Boston elite.
